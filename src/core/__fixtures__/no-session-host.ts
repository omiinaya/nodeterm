/**
 * A `vi.mock` factory that forces `pty-manager` off the session-host backend.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `spawnSession` picks its persistence backend in the order
 * **tmux -> session host -> plain shell**. The session-host branch is taken when tmux is absent
 * (always true on Windows) AND `sessionHostSupported()` is true — and that probe answers nothing
 * more than "is `out/session-host/host.cjs` on disk". So merely having run `npm run build` flips
 * every suite that mocks `node-pty` and expects the plain-shell path: the mocked `spawn` is never
 * called, a real `SessionHostPty` shim is constructed instead, it never connects, and the suite
 * fails with `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'killed')` and 5s timeouts. One file
 * went from 78 passing in 2.8s to 73 failing in 355s purely because a build artifact appeared.
 *
 * A suite that cares which backend it exercises must therefore SAY SO rather than inherit whatever
 * the machine happens to have built — the same reasoning that makes `pty-bundled-tmux.test.ts` pin
 * `os.platform()` to darwin instead of trusting the host.
 *
 * This lives in one place on purpose: the mock has to name every export of
 * `./session-host-backend`, and four copies of that list would drift the first time an export is
 * added — the new export would be `undefined` in three suites and fail somewhere unrelated.
 *
 * Usage, at the top of a suite (the path is relative to the TEST file, not to this fixture):
 *
 *     vi.mock('./session-host-backend', async () =>
 *       (await import('./__fixtures__/no-session-host')).noSessionHost()
 *     )
 *
 * Do NOT use this in a suite that is actually testing the session host — that backend has, and
 * needs, its own coverage.
