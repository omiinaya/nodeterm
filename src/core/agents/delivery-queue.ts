/**
 * DELIVER-ON-IDLE — a bounded, per-target queue with a TTL, and never a silent drop.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Gate 2 refuses a BUSY target (`targetBusy`) and a target between sessions
 * (`targetNotIdleUnknown`), and Eco hibernation leaves an idle node's pane on a SHELL — so
 * `targetNotAgentPane` refuses it *forever* on exactly the nodes an orchestration is most likely to
 * message (the ones sitting idle). "Retry in a moment" pushes that onto a language model with a rate
 * limiter in front of it: a busy-loop that burns tokens. Wake-then-deliver is therefore not a
 * nicety — it is what makes messaging usable across a long-running canvas.
 *
 * So a `targetBusy` / hibernated target with queueing on is ENQUEUED, and delivered when the target
 * next goes idle. `queued` is NOT `delivered`: the bytes have not reached the pane, and the receipt
 * (Task 3.4) is what will close the loop once they do. A queue full stops the sender loudly
 * (`queueFull`), and a message that waits out its TTL EXPIRES loudly — to the trace and to the
 * sender — because a silent drop is the one outcome a security core may never have.
 *
 * ── THE DECSET-2004 MEASUREMENT MADE THIS SAFE (2026-08-15, this host) ───────────────────────────
 *
 * Deliver-on-idle only works if a queued message can be framed into the target's pane WITHOUT a
 * per-delivery bracketed-paste probe. Measured: all four agent CLIs (claude, codex, gemini,
 * opencode) keep DECSET 2004 ON at idle AND during startup, twice each, no flapping — so
 * `paste-buffer -p` frames every flush, including one into a still-starting agent after a wake. The
 * ONE unsafe surface is a NON-agent pane (a plain REPL/terminal): 2004 OFF ⇒ the payload lands as
 * raw keystrokes, one submit per newline. This queue therefore gates on NODE TYPE, not on a runtime
 * probe: it only ever enqueues for a target whose delivery attempt refused as `targetBusy` /
 * `hibernated` — i.e. a pane gate 1 already judged an AGENT pane — and the flush re-runs the whole
 * delivery (gate 1 included), so a pane that became a terminal while queued is refused, never
 * sprayed with unframed lines.
 *
 * ── FLUSH-TIME RE-VALIDATION IS THE LOAD-BEARING PROPERTY ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A message queued for a busy agent must NOT trust the decision that queued it. Ownership can change
 * (the pane is respawned by another project), the grant can be revoked (the switch turned off, the
 * clone notice declined), the flow budget can move — all while the message waits. So the flush does
 * not cache anything: it calls `deps.deliver(req)` again, which is the SAME end-to-end path the verb
 * took (scope → ownership → grant → flow → `deliverAgentMessage`). A grant revoked while queued
 * therefore comes back `notPermitted` at flush and the message is DROPPED, never delivered — pinned
 * by `delivery-queue.test.ts`, which flips the injected `deliver` from `targetBusy` to
 * `notPermitted` between enqueue and flush and asserts nothing reached the pane.
 *
 * ── SHIPS ON BOTH SHELLS, USED ON ONE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Pure `src/core`: no electron, no main import (`no-electron.test.ts`). Every side effect — the
 * clock, the delivery, the wake, the trace, the sender-notify, the timer — is injected, so the whole
 * lifecycle is driven without a pty or a window. The desktop is the only shell that wires a consumer
 * (messaging does not exist on the Server Edition, Task 5.3); the module still compiles and ships
 * there, like everything else in this directory.
