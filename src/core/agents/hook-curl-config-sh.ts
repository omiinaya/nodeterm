/**
 * The one POSIX-sh helper every generated curl client uses to hand its credentials to curl.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS: a command line is not private. `ps` and `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` are world-readable
 * on a stock Linux, so `curl -H "X-Nodeterm-Node-Token: <token>"` publishes that token to every
 * other account on the machine for as long as the curl lives — locally AND on every SSH host,
 * where the hook clients are installed for remote agent nodes. The per-node token exists precisely
 * to answer "which node is calling?"; a co-tenant who scrapes one out of the process table can
 * impersonate that node, and the app-wide bearer alongside it is the key to the whole hook API.
 * So the headers are written into a curl config file on stdin (`--config -`) instead, the same
 * way `usage/remote-claude-usage.ts` and the codex launcher in `codex-identity-proxy.ts` already
 * do it. There is deliberately no argv fallback for an ancient curl: `--config` has been there
 * since the 1990s, and a silent downgrade to argv would be the leak wearing a compatibility hat.
 *
 * ONE COPY OF THE ESCAPING RULE, FOUR CLIENTS: the managed hook script, the canvas-control shim
 * and the context-link shim all send the same hook headers (`HOOK_CURL_HEADERS_SH` below — two
 * credentials plus the client stamp, which only the managed script fills in);
 * the SSH askpass helper in `main/remote-ssh/ssh-askpass.ts` sends a different, single header and
 * builds its own emitter from `curlHeaderConfigSh`. They all go through `headerLine`, because four
 * copies of a quoting rule is how one of them stays wrong.
 */

/**
 * THE ESCAPING RULE, ONCE. A curl config file is LINE-based and its quoted values understand
 * backslash escapes, so exactly four characters could end a header line and start a directive of
 * their own: `"`, `\`, LF and CR. All four are STRIPPED from a value before it is written.
 *
 * Stripping (rather than escaping) is safe here because none can occur in a value we send — the
 * per-node token is `kid.mac` over `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`, the bearer is a `randomUUID()` — so nothing
 * legitimate is altered, and a value that somehow acquired one still cannot break out of its line.
 *
 * Two emitters read this list and no third may invent its own: `headerLine` (POSIX sh, for the
 * generated clients) and `curlHeaderConfigLine` (Node, for a config file this process writes
 * itself). A rule with two copies is a rule where one copy is wrong — which is how the SSH tunnel
 * probe ended up ESCAPING two of the four and ignoring the line breaks entirely.
