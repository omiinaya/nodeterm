// The ONE implementation of the per-agent settings.json hook merge. Each agent's thin
// service calls these with its own config path, script filename, and event list — claude,
// gemini and grok do (grok also passing per-event matchers); codex writes its own hooks.json
// (see its note) and opencode ships a plugin, so neither routes through here. Behavior (ported from the original claude-hooks.ts):
//   - write the managed script for `agentId` to <userData>/agent-hooks/<scriptFileName>
//     (chmod 0o755, best-effort), then reference it as `sh "<scriptPath>"` from each event;
//   - idempotent re-install: drop any prior managed entry for that event (command includes
//     the `agent-hooks` path segment OR the legacy `claude-signals` marker) before pushing
//     the fresh one;
//   - preserve every other hook (other tools', other events);
//   - fail open: a missing/unparseable settings.json defaults to {} (install) / returns
//     early (remove); a write error is caught + warned, never thrown.

 * uninstalled, its user-data dir is cleared, or the server edition ran with a `--data-dir` under
 * a temp path that later got cleaned (see the installHooks note in src/server/config.ts).
 *

 * without status, which is exactly what an uninstalled nodeterm should look like.
