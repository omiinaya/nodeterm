 * (the leak this series closes), it is clobbered by the endpoint-file source, it reaches a session
 * only at tmux CREATION so every running session stays unauthenticated until the node is destroyed,
 * and the phone injects env itself and cannot mint. A file fixes all four.
 *
 * It is exactly as strong as env against a same-uid sibling (nothing makes a token secret from a
 * determined sibling within one uid) and strictly stronger against everyone else.
