/**
 * A PHONE-SPAWNED session is `verified`, and this test is why nobody has to re-derive that.
 *
 * The phone injects exactly two vars (nodeterm-ios TerminalTransport.swift:188):
 * NODETERM_HOOK_ENDPOINT and NODETERM_NODE_ID. No bearer, no port, no token. It does NOT go through
 * ptyManager.create — it types `tmux new-session -A` over its own SSH transport — so the token file
 * it reads was materialised by the PERSIST-time sweep (node-token-service.refreshNodeTokens, wired
 * to onPersist on both shells), not by the spawn path.
 *
 * That distinction is the whole reason this test exists: narrowing materialisation to the spawn path
 * would silently drop every phone-spawned session to `legacy`, and rev.3 of the messaging design
 * would become right by accident, after the fact, with no error anywhere.
 *
 * WHICH HARNESS (the plan offered two): this drives the REAL generated script END-TO-END against a
 * real `node:http` listener on 127.0.0.1 with the real `curl`, and asserts the headers that actually
 * arrived — the same shape as the 2026-08-15 measurement, and the stronger of the two options.
 * Sourcing the script to call `nt_hook_headers` in isolation would prove the emitter and nothing
 * about whether the POST carries it.
 *
 * The env handed to `sh` is EXACTLY the phone's — HOME + PATH (so `curl` and `head` resolve) plus
 * the two vars HookEnv.flags sets. In particular NODETERM_PERM_WAIT_SECS is deliberately absent, so
 * the script takes its normal backgrounded-POST branch; the assertions wait on the listener rather
 * than on the child, because that is what the phone's sessions really do.
