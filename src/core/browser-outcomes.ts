/**
 * The `browser` verb's RETRY table, for the agent-facing docs — the same discipline the messaging
 * verbs get from `RETRYABLE` (`src/core/agents/agent-message-decide.ts`): whether an outcome is
 * worth retrying is DATA, not prose the skill text re-types by hand and lets drift.
 *
 * WHERE THE REFUSALS ACTUALLY LIVE. The driving refusal STRINGS are decided main-side, in
 * `src/main/browser-drive.ts` (the gate), `src/main/browser-actions.ts` (per-action outcomes) and
 * `src/server/control-unsupported.ts` (the Server Edition). This file does not restate those strings
 * — it classifies the OUTCOMES an agent can hit into "retry can clear this" vs "terminal", so
 * `buildCanvasSkillBody` / `buildCanvasControlInstructions` render the guidance from the table and
 * `canvas-control-core.test.ts` reddens if a new bucket is documented without landing here first.
 * It is `src/core` (no electron, both shells compile it), so the doc generator stays electron-free.
 *
 * The classification is honest about what a language model should DO, not about HTTP shape: a switch
 * the agent cannot flip is terminal even though a human could change it, and a discarded page is
 * "retryable" only in the sense that a small act (bring it on screen, open a new one) clears it — the
 * label says which act, so the retry is directed rather than blind.
