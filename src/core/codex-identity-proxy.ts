/**
 * Shared-identity spine for Codex canvas nodes.
 *
 * WHY: a Codex terminal node used to spawn a full `codex` process tree per node — one app-server
 * each. A canvas with a dozen Codex nodes paid a dozen servers' worth of RAM for one account. With
 * this, every node on a machine talks to ONE `codex app-server` and owns one THREAD inside it, and
 * the node ↔ thread mapping is what survives resumes, in-pane restarts and app restarts.
 *
 * The mapping is a tiny file per thread under `<userDataDir>/codex-thread-nodes/`. It is read by
 * generated POSIX sh (the hook prelude in `codex-thread-identity-sh.ts`), so it is a flat
 * `key=value` text file — parsed as DATA, never sourced.
 *
 * WHY IT IS SIGNED: the records name a node id and a hook endpoint, and the hook prelude
 * re-exports both into the agent's environment. An attacker who could write one of these files
 * could aim a session's hook traffic at a node (or an endpoint) of their choosing. Every record
 * therefore carries an HMAC over (threadId, nodeId, endpoint) keyed by the same restart-stable
 * secret the hook server uses to mint per-node capabilities
 * (`src/core/agents/node-auth-secret.ts` — sealed via safeStorage on the desktop, raw 0600 bytes on
 * the Server Edition). Unsigned/mis-signed records are ignored, not repaired.
 *
 * ACCOUNT SCOPING (S6): managed Codex accounts add a directory level above the thread id. A
 * SYSTEM record still lives at the bare root (`<root>/<threadId>`), so a machine with no managed
 * accounts keeps the exact S4 layout and its legacy records keep resolving (Constraint 12). A
 * MANAGED record lives under `<root>/<accountId>/<threadId>`. The HMAC now binds the full 4-tuple
 * (threadId, accountScope, nodeId, hookEndpoint) — an empty account id is normalised to the scope
 * string `system`, and a record whose `accountId=` line disagrees with the directory it sits in is
 * rejected, so an account can never be edited to speak for another's threads. Records written
 * before this slice carry no `accountId=` line and are verified with the original 3-tuple preimage
 * at the system scope only — the one back-compat door, and it is a system-scope door.

  # The authoritative check runs FIRST and unchanged; the stat below only decides WHICH reason to
  # report. Ordering it the other way would let a codex that no longer needs the standalone runtime
  # fall back on a stat we had no business trusting more than the command itself.
  #
  # Two different facts wore one name before: an older CLI with no app-server at all, and a current
  # CLI installed off a channel that ships no standalone runtime (npm, snap) — where the daemon
  # refuses with "managed standalone Codex install not found at
  # <CODEX_HOME>/packages/standalone/current/codex". Caps normally keeps that second case away from
  # here entirely, but the pane resolves CODEX_HOME from its OWN environment (§8.5) and an install
  # can be removed after boot, so the launcher still has to be able to say which it hit.
  #
  # The app-server is a PERSISTENT DAEMON: the FIRST codex node to reach here starts it and every
  # later node reuses it. Start it in a SUBSHELL with THIS node's per-pane NODETERM_* scrubbed, or
  # the daemon — and every tool shell it later spawns for EVERY node — would inherit this one node's
  # NODETERM_NODE_ID. The thread → node resolver (codex-thread-identity-sh.ts) only recovers the
  # right node when a tool shell has NO NODETERM_NODE_ID; a leaked value makes its guard no-op and
  # silently collapses every codex node's identity onto whichever node started the daemon, so
  # Project B's codex lists Project A's links and routes to A (#350). NODETERM_CODEX_ACCOUNT_ID is
  # the ONE var deliberately KEPT: one daemon serves one account, and the resolver reads it from the
  # daemon's env to pick the record scope. The unset runs BEFORE the (test-injected) start command.
