// Atomic file writes that survive Windows.
//
// Every store in this app persists the same way: write a temp file, then rename it over the
// target, so a reader sees either the old bytes or the new ones and never a half-written file.
// That is correct on POSIX, where `rename(2)` is atomic and replaces the destination
// unconditionally.
//
// It is NOT sufficient on Windows, and the difference is quiet. `MoveFileEx` fails with a sharing
// violation — surfacing through Node as `EPERM` (sometimes `EACCES`/`EBUSY`) — whenever the
// DESTINATION is open by anyone at that instant. Not held open for long: opened. The usual
// culprits are not exotic:
//
//   - Windows Defender's real-time scanner opens each file we just wrote, to scan it;
//   - the search indexer does the same;
//   - a backup or sync client (OneDrive over a user profile, very common) holds a read handle;
//   - two of our own concurrent writers race their renames onto one destination.
//
// The last one was reproducible on demand and exposed this: the approved-devices store originally
// had three un-queued writers, and its old overlapping-save test failed on Windows with
// `EPERM: operation not permitted, rename`. The store now also serializes its read-modify-write
// decisions, but retrying rename remains required for scanners/indexers and independent processes.
//
// The consequence is worse than a failed save. These are the stores holding the user's canvas
// layout, their settings, their pinned remote devices and their sealed credentials. On Windows a
// scanner touching the file at the wrong millisecond turned a routine save into a thrown error,
// and the save was simply lost — intermittently, unreproducibly, and more often on exactly the
// machines that are most protected.
//
// One file already knew. `src/core/github/cache.ts` carried a full write-up of this — naming
// EPERM, naming NTFS, and citing a direct measurement: "two concurrent writers to one path failed
// with EPERM in roughly 3 of 5 runs on this host" — and had its own bounded retry loop. It had had
// it for some time. The knowledge sat in that one file and reached none of the other twenty-odd
// stores doing the identical thing a few directories away, because a comment cannot propagate and
// nothing scanned for the pattern. That is the argument for the guard test beside this file rather
// than for another comment: a written explanation protects the file it is written in.
//
// The fix is the standard one: retry the rename briefly. Each attempt is still a single atomic
// rename, so retrying cannot tear a write — it only tries the same indivisible operation again
// once whoever held the destination has let go. The window these scanners hold is milliseconds.
//
// What this deliberately does NOT do:
//   - It does not retry forever. A genuinely locked file must fail, and fail loudly: several
//     callers (revocation.ts's `persisted:false`, for one) have contracts that depend on a failed
//     save being reported as a failed save.
//   - It does not retry every error. `ENOENT` means the temp file is gone, which is a bug in the
//     caller, and retrying only delays a clearer error. `ENOSPC` will not improve by waiting.
//   - It does not swallow the final failure. The last error is thrown with its original code.
