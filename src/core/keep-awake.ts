// Keep awake while agents work: hold an idle-sleep power assertion while at least one LOCAL
// agent node is actively `working`, and release it the moment the last one stops — so a long
// unattended run survives the laptop's Energy Saver settings without turning nodeterm into an
// app that pins the machine awake for as long as it is open.
//
// Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-18-keep-awake-design.md. Scope rules:
//   - LOCAL nodes only. The mirror carries SSH-homed nodes too (hook events tunnel in), but their
//     work happens on the remote host — they must never keep THIS machine awake.
//   - `working` only. `needsYou` (waiting on the human) and `done` both RELEASE: a question nobody
//     answers overnight must not hold the laptop out of sleep.
//   - Assertion leaks are impossible by construction: every exit that never sends its own edge
//     (crash, Esc mid-tool, dropped SSH, node deleted while working) is covered by the mirror's
//     stale sweep (`sweepStaleWorking`, shared/agents/stale.ts WORKING_STALE_MS), which fires a
//     synthetic `end` edge per silent node through the SAME onNodeStateChange seam this tracker
//     folds — worst case the assertion outlives the last real work by that window, never forever.
//     A session boundary mid-`working` resets the mirror entry to idle, out of the sweep's
//     jurisdiction: a session END fires its own 'Ended' edge (produceInboxFromState's mid-turn
//     branch), while a SessionStart is deliberately silent upstream (ending there would kill the
//     activity of the turn just beginning) — that one gap, and any future silent reset, is closed
//     by `sync()`, which the shell calls on every mirror flush to make the tracker converge to
//     the mirror's own `working` set — and the silent reset is itself an event, so it schedules
//     the very flush (WRITE_DEBOUNCE_MS) that releases the assertion moments later.
//
// Electron-free (src/core): the actual powerSaveBlocker lives behind the injected `blocker` seam
// (template: session-budget.ts); the thin shell in src/main/keep-awake.ts binds it.
