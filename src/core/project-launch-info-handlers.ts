/**
 * `project-settings:launch-info` — the single read a launcher warms before it may consume a
 * shared-sourced value out of `resolveProjectSettings`'s answer (SDD: consumption plan, Task 1).
 *
 * A SIBLING `register*` (the `project-setup-handlers.ts` shape), not a widening of
 * `WorkspaceStore.registerIpc()`: the store has no trust-store dependency anywhere else, and giving
 * it one just to serve this one channel would spread the trust boundary across a file that
 * currently has none. Both shells already construct a `ProjectTrustStore` (main/server wiring) and
 * call a sibling `register*Handlers` for the setup runner right next to it — this follows the same
 * construction-order point.
 *
 * Only `agents`/`shell` are reported (not `setup`, though it is a `ProjectTrustFamily` too) —
 * `setup` already has its own gate at RUN time in `project-setup-service.ts`; this channel is for
 * consumers that need to know ahead of a launch, not another copy of that gate.
