 *     shared-content hash is trusted at this LOCATION — the verdict computed by
 *     `projectFamilyTrusted`, the same helper `project-settings:launch-info` reports from.
 *  3. An untrusted shared value is OMITTED and the family's consent dialog is requested
 *     fire-and-forget. The spawn is never delayed by it.
 *  4. Everything else fails OPEN: no settings, an unreadable document, a throwing trust store, a
 *     throwing `requestTrust` — all answer "no overrides", never an exception into the spawn path.
