 * network, host unreachable), used to fall straight through to the LOCAL tmux/plain-shell branch —
 * a local shell in the local `$HOME` carrying the remote node's id, its `SSH user@host` header
 * chip, and (agent nodes) a cold-restore `--resume` typed on the wrong machine. Nothing in the
 * result said so, so it read as "the session reconnected".
