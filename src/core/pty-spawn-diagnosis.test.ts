/**
 * WHAT THE SPAWN FAILURE SAYS — the CATCH path, i.e. a spawn node-pty actually attempted and lost.
 *
 * node-pty reports every failure as a bare `posix_spawnp failed.` with the errno discarded, so the
 * error message is assembled from measurements taken after the fact. This pins the wiring: the
 * pty-DEVICE measurement actually reaches the message, and it replaces the generic
 * restart/rebuild advice rather than being appended to it (2026-08-11 — the machine was at
 * `kern.tty.ptmx_max`, and the message talked about architecture).
 *
 * The device numbers below therefore describe the machine AS MEASURED AFTER THE FAILURE. The other
 * way to be told the machine is full — the pre-flight refusing before node-pty is called at all —
 * is a different code path and lives in pty-spawn-preflight.test.ts. Keeping them apart matters:
 * once the pre-flight existed, a fixture that simply reads "exhausted" would be refused up front
 * and these tests would silently stop exercising the catch at all.
 */

/**
 * Every spawn in this file fails: the message is the whole subject. Counted, because "node-pty was
 * reached at all" is the one thing that distinguishes this file's path from the pre-flight's — and
 * a fixture drift that quietly routed these tests through the refusal instead would otherwise
 * still produce a passing, and identical, message.
