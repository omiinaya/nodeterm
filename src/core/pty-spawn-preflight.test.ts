/**
 * THE SPAWN THAT IS NEVER ATTEMPTED.
 *
 * node-pty's darwin spawn path leaks the pty it opened when `posix_spawn` fails: `pty_posix_spawn`
 * (node_modules/node-pty/src/unix/pty.cc) opens the master with `posix_openpt` and the slave with
 * `open()`, and on the error branch `PtyFork` throws without closing either — measured at exactly 2
 * `/dev/ptmx` fds + 1 `/dev/ttys*` fd, i.e. 2 pty DEVICES, per failed spawn.
 *
 * That makes device exhaustion self-amplifying: at the ceiling every spawn fails, every failure
 * eats two more devices, and the ceiling gets further away (a 31-minute-old main held 479 masters
 * against 28 tmux panes). We cannot fix node-pty from here, so the fix is to stop feeding it: when
 * the machine is already out of devices, the spawn is refused BEFORE node-pty is called at all.
 *
 * The refusal is only ever allowed on a MEASURED reading. A wrong block is worse than a leak — it
 * would refuse terminals on a healthy machine — so anything unmeasured spawns as it always did.
 */

/**
 * Every node-pty call is recorded, because "was it called" is the whole subject here. It can also
 * be told to fail, so the one test that needs the CATCH path (proving the arch mock below is real)
 * can have it without a second file.
