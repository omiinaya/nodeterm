// TYPING ATTRIBUTION — who wrote into which node's terminal (docs/team-presence.md).
//
// Stage 2 makes a terminal co-attachable, so a keystroke arriving at the pty is no longer
// self-evidently "the one user's". `pty:write` is therefore registered SENDER-AWARE, and the
// sending client is stamped onto the node id (the session's persistKey) via presenceHub.noteTyping
// — that is the whole "X is typing" ring. Attribution is server-side: the transport already knows
// who the sender is (webContents id / uiId / relay HostSession), so no client can claim to be
// someone else, and a phone typing over the relay is attributed with zero client-side change.
