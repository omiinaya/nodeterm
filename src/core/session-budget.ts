// Session budget: reap long-idle DETACHED nt- tmux sessions under memory pressure (or past a
// count cap), so abandoned agent sessions can't accumulate until the host swaps itself to death
// (field report: 95 sessions / 34 GB of idle claude processes on one host).
//
// This is the tmux counterpart of the renderer's WebGL budget (`terminal/webgl-budget.ts`), and it
// deliberately reuses that design's rules rather than inventing an expiry policy:
//   - a bounded budget, enforced only when exceeded — never a calendar-based expiry;
//   - eviction picks the LEAST-RECENTLY-ACTIVE holder — where ACTIVE means the pane last produced
//     OUTPUT. tmux's `#{session_activity}` looks like that number and is not: it is bumped by every
//     client ATTACH, and nodeterm attaches on every reconnect, so on a live host it never ages past
//     a few minutes. Gating on it made this whole module a no-op — measured, and worse than a
//     no-op: with a short grace it reaped the session that was printing and spared the abandoned
//     one. `SessionInfo.outputSec` (`#{window_activity}`) is the honest clock; see its doc.
//   - an ATTACHED session (someone is looking at it) is never evicted, exactly like a visible
//     WebGL holder; a recently-active one is protected by a grace window (the release delay).
//     "Attached" means a WATCHER: this app's own control-mode shadows are tmux clients too, and
//     they are subtracted from tmux's flag via the `shadowed` seam — see SessionReaperOpts;
//   - reaping is gradual (per-sweep batch), so one sweep can never mass-kill its way past the
//     target — the next sweep re-evaluates.
//
// Killing a detached session is safe BECAUSE of the cold-restore contract: to the node, a reap is
// indistinguishable from a machine reboot. On next open `tmux has-session` fails → fresh=true →
// the renderer replays the scrollback snapshot and re-launches a resumable agent
// (`claude --resume …`). For that to hold, the reaper must kill ONLY the tmux session: it must
// never delete scrollback snapshots and never write a pty-manager tombstone (both belong to the
// user-deletes-the-node path, `destroySession`).
//
// Electron-free (src/core): all exec/mem/clock access is behind injectable seams (template:
// ack-sweep.ts), so both shells boot it and tests drive it without touching tmux.

 *
 * ── WHY THE DETACHED CAP IS A HOST-SCALED PER-INSTANCE NUMBER, NOT A HOST-WIDE COUNT ────────────
 *
 * The cap used to be the constant 48, and on a shared host that is a cap on nothing: each nodeterm
 * instance runs as its own uid and sees only its own tmux socket, so seven instances each sat one
 * session under their own 48 while the machine drowned. The obvious fix — count the host's sessions
 * instead of ours — was MEASURED and is not available:
 *
 *   - the per-uid socket dirs are 0700 (`/tmp/tmux-1002` is `drwx------ projects`), and a second
 *     uid attempting to list one gets `Permission denied`;
 *   - `/proc` is mounted `hidepid=invisible`, so a non-root uid cannot even SEE another user's
 *     processes — user `projects` counted 62 processes host-wide and 62 of its own.
 *
 * So no instance can enumerate, or even detect, another instance's sessions. A truly host-wide
 * COUNT is unreachable without a shared broker, and inventing one is a much larger change than
 * this. What every uid CAN read — verified as an unprivileged user on the same host — is
 * `/proc/meminfo` and `/proc/pressure/memory`. **The host-wide facts are the MEMORY facts, so the
 * host-aware trigger is the memory one (`hostUnderMemoryPressure`), and that is the load-bearing
 * half of this change.** Every instance sees the same pressure at the same moment and each trims
 * its own sessions, which converges without any of them seeing the others.
 *
 * The count cap is then demoted to what it honestly is: a per-instance sanity backstop. It still
 * stops being a constant, because a constant is wrong in the other direction too — 48 detached
 * agent sessions is ~23 GB of nominal RSS, which is most of a 32 GB laptop and all of a 16 GB one.
 * Derived instead as `HOST_SHARE` of host RAM divided by `NOMINAL_SESSION_MB`, clamped to
 * [8, 48]. On the 62.7 GB host that is 32 (down from 48); on a 24 GB Mac it would be 12, which is
 * exactly why it is NOT derived when there is no host reading — see the `mem === null` case below.
 *
 * Seven instances at 25% each over-subscribe the machine, and that is deliberate rather than
 * overlooked: an instance cannot know how many peers it has, and a share small enough to be safe
 * with seven would cripple the single-user desktop that is the common case. Over-subscription is
 * safe here precisely BECAUSE the memory term is host-wide — the backstop may be loose, because it
 * is not the thing standing between this host and a swap-thrash lockup.
 *
 * `mem === null` (darwin, or an unreadable /proc) keeps the historical 48. The count cap needs no
 * memory reading to work, so deriving it from `os.totalmem()` would quietly change reaping
 * behaviour on macOS — a cap of 12 on a 24 GB Mac — off a host figure whose meaning there this
 * module has already been burned by twice (see `hostMemReader`). A platform gets a new default
 * when it has been measured, not when a number happens to be available.

 * not pressure; a missing or unparsed PSI figure is not pressure; `swapTotalMb === 0` (no swap
 * configured) is not pressure. Every one of those makes the reaper do LESS, which is the safe

 * than about half an hour, so no grace window could ever elapse and this function returned an
 * empty plan on a host that was 84% into its swap.
 *
 * A deliberate trade-off rides on that clock: PASSIVELY VIEWING a session no longer protects it.
 * Attaching and reading a pane without pressing a key moves neither `window_activity` (measured —
 * attach does not bump it) nor, therefore, `outputSec`, so a long-silent session someone glanced at
 * an hour ago is still eligible. Accepted because the exposure is narrow — an ATTACHED session is
 * never eligible at all, a single keystroke's echo restamps the clock, and the grace window still
 * applies — and because the alternative is the attach clock this module just stopped trusting.
 *
 * Eligible = named `nt-*` AND detached AND silent past the grace window. Then:
 *   - memory below the watermark → up to `batchMax` (a failed memory read — `mem === null` — is
 *     NOT pressure: absence of evidence never triggers the primary path);

 *     memory and sat well under `maxDetached` while being unable to open a single terminal, so
 *     every term above was zero and the sweep the shell fired was a no-op;
 *   - detached count over `maxDetached` → the excess, even with healthy memory;
 * combined take is bounded by `batchMax`.
 *
 * An allowance is not an exemption: `externalPressure` raises how MANY of the eligible may go, and
 * touches nothing about which sessions are eligible. Attached sessions and sessions inside the
 * grace window stay unkillable under it, exactly as under memory pressure — that is this module's

 * successful listing can put a session on the kill list, and the kill is re-verified against a
 * FRESH listing at kill time (a session that got attached between plan and kill is spared).
