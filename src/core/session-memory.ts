 * different things and `rss` is the wrong one here. Measured on a real Mac (2026-08-12, 8 claude
 * processes captured in the same tick against Apple's own `footprint` tool):
 *   - ACTIVE processes: footprint/rss ≈ 1, and one read **0.73×** — `rss` counts shared resident
 *     pages that footprint does not, so the two accountings diverge in BOTH directions.
 *   - IDLE processes: **1.84–2.20×**. macOS moves an idle process's pages into the compressor,
 *     which drops out of `rss` but stays in footprint.
 * That is the population this panel exists to describe: it asks what idle sessions cost, and macOS
 * compresses exactly those. `rss` therefore understated a six-hour-idle session by about half.
 *
 * `phys_footprint` is also what Activity Monitor's "Memory" column shows, which makes the panel
 * agree with the pill — the pill's `vm_stat` reading already counts compressor pages and was
 * verified against Activity Monitor to 0.05%. Two surfaces describing one machine must not use two
 * accountings.
 *
 * Format facts, all MEASURED on that host (980 data rows) rather than assumed:
 *   - ~10 header lines, a blank, then a `PID    MEM` column header; data follows. We locate that
 *     header rather than counting lines, because the header block's size is not a contract.
 *   - The MEM column is LEFT-aligned in five characters, so values carry TRAILING SPACES
 *     (`12M  `, `859M `, `1314M`). A naive `/M$/` misses two thirds of them.
 *   - Units seen: `K` (553 rows) and `M` (427). `G` was never observed — a 1314M process stayed in
 *     M — but `top`'s own header prints `PhysMem: 23G`, so `G` is accepted anyway.
 *   - `B` and any restricted-process rendering were NOT observed and are deliberately not guessed:
 *     an unrecognised suffix skips the row, the same tolerance the rest of this file uses.
 *   - `top` rounds the M column to whole megabytes (29M and 28M across two ticks); K rows keep kB
 *     precision. The panel renders MB, so the rounding is below what it shows.
 *   - pid 0 (`kernel_task`) appears and is accessible; column spacing varies with pid width.
