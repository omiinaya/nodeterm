// TEST-ONLY: choosing a private `TMUX_TMPDIR` for the `*.realtmux.test.ts` suites.
//
// Two things a real-tmux test has to get right about its socket, and each has bitten this repo:
//
// 1. **It must be private**, so `afterAll`'s `rm -rf` is the one cleanup path. `kill-server` stops
//    the server but never unlinks the socket file, so a per-pid name in the SHARED `/tmp/tmux-<uid>/`
//    leaves one dead entry behind per run, forever — measured at 14 stale `nt-envtest-*` sockets on
//    one dev machine before this module existed.
// 2. **It must be SHORT.** A unix socket path is bound into a fixed `sockaddr_un.sun_path`, and the
//    macOS per-user temp root is already 56 characters before anything is added to it. This is not
//    theoretical: `local-send-keys.realtmux.test.ts` came to 106 and every test in it failed with
//    `error connecting to …: File name too long`, which reads like a broken test rather than a
//    path-length limit. Its sibling passed at 97 — six characters from the same failure.
//
// Production is not exposed to (2): `PtyManager` binds `-L node-terminal` under the default
// `/tmp/tmux-<uid>/`, which is short on every platform we ship to.
