// Storage for user-pasted browser cookies, per provider.
//
// Some providers (MiniMax, opencode) publish no CLI credential on disk — their quota lives
// behind a web console session — so the only way to read it is to replay a cookie the user
// copies out of DevTools.
//
// These deliberately do NOT live in settings.json. That file is written with default
// permissions and is treated throughout the app as CONFIG — the `claudeAccounts` list sits
// there precisely because an account list is config, not a credential. A session cookie is the
// opposite: a live bearer credential for someone's account. It gets its own file at 0600 and
// never appears in a config blob that is world-readable, copied between machines, or pasted
// into a bug report.
//
// Generalized from the MiniMax-only version once opencode needed exactly the same thing; the
// file naming is unchanged (`<provider>-cookie.json`), so an already-stored MiniMax cookie is
// still found.

 * a second LIVE process on the same data dir; that setup has no lock to begin with, and the worst
 * case is that process's rename failing cleanly (ENOENT, rethrown to its caller) instead of a
 * forgotten cookie sitting on disk forever.
