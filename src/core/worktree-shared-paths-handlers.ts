/**
 * RPC surface for `worktree:materialize-shared`, registered once per shell (Electron main + Server
 * Edition) through CorePlatform — the `project-setup-handlers.ts` / `project-launch-info-handlers.ts`
 * sibling-registrar shape.
 *
 * The wire carries ONLY `(projectId, worktreePath)`. It NEVER carries the `sharedPaths` list: a
 * renderer-supplied list of relative paths is untrusted input (it could name anything, and would
 * also let a compromised renderer materialize links a project never opted into). The handler reads
 * the list ITSELF, by projectId, out of the project's resolved settings
 * (`readSettings` → `resolveProjectSettings` → `worktree.sharedPaths`).
 *
 * The trust boundary is the SAME one the setup runner uses (`resolveProjectSetupTarget`): rootPath
 * (= the project's `cwd`) is derived from THIS process's own workspace index by projectId, never the
 * caller, and `worktreePath` is independently validated to be either that rootPath or one of the
 * project's ACTUAL git worktrees — else the call is refused with `[]`. An SSH project is refused the
 * same way (materialization is local-only this PR; `resolveProjectSetupTarget` already rejects an
 * ssh target that carries a worktreePath, and we re-check `target.ssh` here as defense in depth).
 * Every refusal — unknown project, bad worktreePath, ssh, non-string args, no configured
 * sharedPaths — answers `[]`, the same shape a real "nothing was linked" answer uses, so a caller
 * needs no extra branch.
