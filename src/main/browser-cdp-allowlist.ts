/**
 * THE CDP allowlist. The single gate every command bound for `debugger.sendCommand` passes through
 * (the one caller is `browser-cdp-send.ts`, pinned structurally by this file's test). Default-DENY:
 * an unknown method, or a known method with a parameter the validator rejects, is REFUSED — nothing
 * falls through.
 *
 * It is NOT a set of method names. The danger in a page-side-eval command is not its name, it is one
 * parameter — and a name-keyed list also cannot express the URL check on Page.navigate. So the table
 * is (method, params-validator) pairs, each validator inspecting exactly the parameters that make its
 * method safe or not.
 *
 * Lives in `src/main`, enforced on the way into the debugger — NEVER in the renderer (the half an
 * XSS-in-a-node-title style bug lands in) and never in the shim or a skill document. Browser control
 * exists only on the Electron desktop; Server Edition / Mobile never reach here.
 *
 * Excluded outright and for stated reasons: arbitrary page-side evaluation
 * (Runtime.evaluate/compileScript/runScript/addBinding) and the whole Debugger domain (a second route
 * to it), Fetch (request interception is a proxy for the user's session), Security (can disable
 * certificate errors), Storage / IndexedDB / DOMStorage (the token stores this whole design exists to
 * keep out), DOM.getOuterHTML / getAttributes (the full-DOM read arriving by another door),
 * Page.bringToFront (a page that can raise itself can steal a click the user aimed elsewhere) and
 * Network.getAllCookies (one call empties the jar for every site the profile ever touched, and no
 * useful audit line names a domain). None of these is in the table, so default-deny refuses them.
