/**
 * The debugger LEASE: attach on the first verb, detach after {@link LEASE_IDLE_MS} of idleness,
 * re-attach on the next verb. The attachment is deliberately NOT the indicator — an attach is
 * invisible by itself and a detach-on-idle would blank a chip for a lease that is still live — so the
 * chip binds to the ledger's `leaseActiveUntil` instead (PR 6). Every command routes through the one
 * send wrapper ({@link import('./browser-cdp-send').sendCdp}) and therefore through the allowlist.
 *
 * PROBE (Task 5.0, docs/superpowers/probes/2026-08-browser-debugger.md), measured on Electron 42.8.1:
 * a programmatic `webContents.debugger.attach()` and a user-opened DevTools window on the same
 * <webview> guest are NOT mutually exclusive — attach succeeds with DevTools already open, and
 * DevTools opens while a programmatic attachment stays live. So on this version the DevTools-specific
 * attach-failure sentence ({@link browserDevToolsOpenMessage}) is UNREACHABLE: it stays wired behind
 * an injected `isDevToolsOpen` check (design §2.3 rule 1 — name the cause, never "not drivable") in
 * case a future Electron bump reintroduces the single-client rule, but attach does not fail for that
 * reason today. The generic named attach-failure path is the one that runs.
 *
 * CDP child-session bookkeeping is lifted from PR #112's S8 with credit to @Corvin (proteus-dev) —
 * the flat-mode `Target.attachToTarget`, the per-target session map, and BOTH invalidation points.
 * Its THIRD invalidation trigger — a handoff to a different controlling session — is designed away
 * rather than reimplemented: there is no handoff in this design (Task 4.3), so removing the feature
 * that needed the care beats reimplementing the care.
 *
 * Electron-adjacent (holds a debugger on a page with real logins) → `src/main`, never Server Edition.
