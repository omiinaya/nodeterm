// Atomic-write behaviour of the two files a revoke rewrites: ~/.nodeterm/agent.json and
// ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.
//
// The service serializes its two entry points through one mutate chain (pinned in
// pairing-service.test.ts), and `writeAgentJson` / `removeAuthorizedKeysForDevice` live inside the
// factory below `serialize`, so no code path outside the closure can reach them unchained. What
// the chain cannot see: the host agent is a separate PROCESS writing the same files, and a crash
// between tmp-write and rename is possible regardless. Both files were once written through a
// fixed `<file>.tmp`, where one writer's rename could publish the other's half-written file, or
// move the tmp out from under it and make the loser's rename fail — unique per-call names are the
// defense this file pins.
//
// agent.json is the credential case: each device entry carries the `agentToken` bearer the phone
// uses on the host-agent WebSocket, so a temp left behind IS a leaked credential — hence the
// orphan sweep pinned below, which agent.json needs and authorized_keys (public keys) does not.
//
// AGENT_DIR / AUTH_KEYS_PATH are derived from `os.homedir()` at MODULE LOAD, so the homedir mock
// must be in place before the import: `vi.mock('os')` plus a dynamic import per test, with
// `vi.resetModules()` between them.
