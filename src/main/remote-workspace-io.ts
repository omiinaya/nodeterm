 * Remote .nodeterm IO over the project's existing ControlMaster. Fail-open on writes: while the
 * project is disconnected a write is a quiet no-op (false) — the cache in workspace.json keeps
 * the project usable offline. Reads are CHECKED: a down connection or ssh failure reports
 * `error`, never `absent` — the reconciler treats only a real "no such file" as absence.
 * Writes are throttled per project (the renderer already debounces at 800 ms; a remote
 * round-trip per keystroke burst is still too chatty — spec says ~5 s). A throttled write is
 * acked optimistically; if the trailing run later fails, `onDropped` reports it back so the
 * store re-owes the mirror instead of believing it landed.
 *
 * The settings pair (`readSettings`/`writeSettings`, `.nodeterm/settings.json`) rides the same
 * connection but NOT the throttle — see `writeSettings`. `flush()` therefore still covers only
 * project.json's pending writes: a settings write has already been on the wire when it returns.
