// Relay advertisement — the cure for the LAN-only-pairing trap without re-pairing.
//
// `connection.relay` on the phone is otherwise written at exactly ONE moment (the pairing
// exchange), so a phone paired while "Reach this Mac from anywhere" was OFF stayed LAN-only
// forever: flipping the toggle later changed nothing, and off-LAN every open died with a raw
// connection error (field report). While the standing phone host is UP, we now advertise the
// relay identity in ~/.nodeterm/relay.json. The phone reads it over the SAME TOFU-verified SSH
// bootstrap it already uses for agent.json, then mints its own device token against the API
// (the free-tier TOFU mint). The file carries ONLY public material — the same block every
// pairing QR embeds, plus this desktop's device id for that mint; relay ACCESS remains gated
// host-side by the pin-once SAS approval, exactly as for a pairing-minted identity.
