// Probe the local Claude CLI once, up front (never awaited — a launch is never blocked on it):
// `--permission-mode auto` only exists in Claude Code >= 2.1.71, and until we know the version we
// conservatively omit the flag. The shell warms the same memo at startup, so this normally
// resolves immediately.
void ensureClaudeCliCaps()

// Same shape, same reason: a Codex launch line names the managed shared-identity launcher only if
// this machine has one installed and armed. Unprobed ⇒ plain `codex`, which is what every Codex
// node ran before this feature — never a launcher path that might not resolve.
void ensureCodexIdentityCaps()

// One env snapshot for `${env:VAR}` expansion, fetched up front and cached (src/renderer/lib/
// agentEnv.ts): the Settings preview and every launch path expand against the same object, so the
// preview cannot drift from the typed command. Browser/relay bridges resolve `{}` by design and
// expansion degrades to the missing-env refusal. Not awaited — an unexpanded first-frame launch
// of a `${env:…}`-referencing custom agent refuses via missingEnv rather than blocking boot.
void refreshAgentEnv()

// Note: StrictMode is intentionally not used — its double mount in dev would open
// two PTY sessions per terminal node.
