/**
 * Source-level parity: every `node.new*` command in the registry has a handler in Canvas.tsx.
 *
 * `CommandHandlers` is a `Partial<Record<CommandId, …>>` (deliberately — most registry commands
 * are owned by local listeners or by the main process, not by the canvas dispatcher), so the
 * compiler can never tell you a create command shipped with no handler. It would simply be a
 * remappable row in Settings whose chord does nothing, with the user's own binding as the only
 * evidence. Same discipline as `hook-verified-parity.test.ts`: read the source, assert the key.
