/** Non-blocking strip shown when the active project's .nodeterm file changed on disk
 *  while there are unsaved local edits. Reload = take the disk version; Keep mine =
 *  overwrite disk with the in-memory canvas on the next save.
 *
 *  It only ever covers the OVERLAPPING half of an outside change: nodes that arrived from another
 *  device (a session the phone registered) are adopted onto the canvas before this bar is raised,
 *  because nothing re-emits them and either button would otherwise be able to delete a running
 *  session. `addedCount` is how many did — the message says so, so the user is not asked to weigh
 *  a choice against something that is no longer at stake. */
