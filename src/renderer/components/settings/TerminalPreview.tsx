/**
 * A live, non-interactive xterm rendering a sample screen with the user's current appearance
 * settings — so picking a theme or nudging the line height is a look, not a guess-and-check trip
 * back to the canvas.
 *
 * Two things this must NOT do:
 * - **Register with the WebGL budget coordinator.** Contexts are a hard-capped shared resource
 *   (`terminal/webgl-budget.ts`); a preview that took one would evict a real terminal every time
 *   the Settings panel opened. It stays on the DOM renderer, which is what a static 46×9 sample
 *   wants anyway.
 * - **Accept input.** `disableStdin` keeps it a picture. It can still take FOCUS on click, which is
 *   the only way to see the active (rather than the inactive) cursor style.
