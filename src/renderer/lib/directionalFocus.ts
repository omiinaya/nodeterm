/**
 * "Focus the node over there" — which node a directional move (⌘←/→/↑/↓) lands on, and which
 * node the gesture starts from when nothing is focused yet.
 *
 * The gesture is the one terminal multiplexers give you for free (Ghostty's `goto_split`, tmux's
 * `select-pane -L`, i3's `focus left`), but those all navigate a TREE OF SPLITS where "the pane to
 * the left" is a structural fact. On a canvas there is no tree: nodes are free-form rectangles the
 * user dragged, so the answer has to be inferred from geometry.
 *
 * Nearest-by-distance is the obvious inference and the wrong one — the closest node in the raw
 * Euclidean sense is very often the one diagonally up-and-left, so ⌘→ lands somewhere the user
 * never pointed. Candidates are therefore ranked in TWO TIERS:
 *
 *   Tier 0 — the candidate's perpendicular span OVERLAPS the origin's. These are the nodes a user
 *            would call "in the same row" (for a horizontal move) or "the same column" (vertical),
 *            and one of them is the answer whenever one exists, however far away it sits. Ordered
 *            by distance along the axis, so the immediate neighbour beats the one behind it.
 *   Tier 1 — no overlap, i.e. reachable only diagonally. Ordered by axial distance plus a
 *            {@link PERPENDICULAR_WEIGHT} penalty on the sideways offset, which is what stops a
 *            far-off-axis node beating a nearly-aligned one. This tier is why a node sitting alone
 *            on its row is not a dead end in every direction — a dead end there reads as the
 *            feature being broken, not as a deliberate boundary.
 *
 * Ties break on node id, so one canvas always answers the same way and the tests can state it.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO wrap-around: the last node in a direction is the end of the line, which
 * is what `goto_split` does and what keeps repeated presses from cycling forever.
 *
 * Every rect comes from `nodeFocus`'s `nodeFitRect`/`absolutePosition`, never from `node.position`
 * directly, and that is load-bearing rather than tidy: a GROUPED node's own `position` is relative
 * to its frame, so comparing one against a top-level node's compares two different coordinate
 * spaces. A terminal sitting at (24, 60) inside a frame parked at (4000, 0) would otherwise look
 * like the leftmost node on the canvas, and ⌘← from anywhere would fly to it.
