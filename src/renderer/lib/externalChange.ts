/** What to do with an outside edit to the active project's `.nodeterm/project.json`.
 *
 *  Two very different things arrive on the SAME broadcast (`workspaceExternalChange`):
 *
 *  1. A **git pull / another machine** rewrote the file. The disk side and the local side can
 *     genuinely disagree about the same nodes, so the user has to pick — that is the conflict bar,
 *     and it is re-fetchable: whatever is discarded is still in the remote/branch.
 *  2. The **phone registered a session it just started** (`appendProjectNode`, or the SSH poll
 *     picking that up). That is purely ADDITIVE — a node id nothing here has ever seen, backed by
 *     a tmux session that is already running. Nothing re-emits it: parking it behind a bar and
 *     then answering "Keep my version" (or merely switching projects, which drops the bar and lets
 *     the next whole-workspace save write our canvas over disk) DELETES a live session, headless.
 *
 *  So an incoming node we do not have is adopted ALWAYS — in the merge case and in the conflict
 *  case alike. It cannot collide with a local edit (no local node carries that id), and it is the
 *  only part of the payload nobody can produce a second time. The bar then decides only the REST,
 *  keeping its documented meaning ("the disk side is re-fetchable") intact.
