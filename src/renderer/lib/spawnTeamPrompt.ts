// The conductor prompt behind the user-facing "Spawn a team…" entry (issue #78). The app ships
// no built-in model, so the role split is BYO by design: the entry point opens ONE agent node
// pre-prompted with the task, and that conductor uses its own manage-nodeterm-canvas skill to
// plan and spawn the team. Kept out of React (verifyPanel.ts precedent) so the wording is
// unit-testable.

/**
 * The prompt the conductor node launches with.
 *
 * "Build with Nodeterm orchestration" is load-bearing: it is the trigger phrase the
 * manage-nodeterm-canvas skill documents (canvas-control-core.ts, "Nodeterm orchestration"
 * section), and the whole station/worktree/collect-and-synthesize doctrine hangs off it —
 * re-stating that doctrine here would just be a second copy to drift. The only thing this
 * prompt adds is the worktree decision, which is the user's (the dialog checkbox), not the
 * conductor's.
 *
 * Written as prose on one line: createAgentNode collapses all whitespace to single spaces when
 * it bakes the prompt into the launch argv, so bullets or newlines would arrive mangled.
