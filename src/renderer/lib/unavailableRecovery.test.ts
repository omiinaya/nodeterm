/**
 * Issue #385 — a project whose `.nodeterm/project.json` the user deleted stayed crossed out
 * forever. The placeholder is minted at load when the ref can't be read, a save deliberately
 * emits a header-only ref for it (never a file), and `openFolderProject` reuses the entry by cwd
 * while `reopenProject` clears only `closed` — so nothing ever cleared `unavailable` for a local
 * project and the state sustained itself.
 *
 * The decision must rest on EVIDENCE: clearing the flag lets the next save write the placeholder's
 * empty canvas, which would destroy a file that is present but momentarily unreadable.
