 * scaled by `window.devicePixelRatio` was tried here (to guard the re-register that follows a
 * display change against a measurement taken on the display we left) and reverted, for reasons
 * worth keeping so it is not tried a third time:
 *  - There is no staleness window to guard. `CoreBrowserService.dpr` is a live getter over

 *    the dimensions against that live dpr. By the time `setupGlyph` reads it, `device.cell` is the
 *    NEW display's.
 *  - `css × dpr` does not reproduce it anyway. xterm rounds the CSS canvas
 *    (`css.canvas.width = round(device.cell.width * cols / dpr)`) and divides that by `cols`, so
 *    the CSS cell carries a per-terminal residual — the same rounding `addon.ts` documents and
 *    reproduces.
 *  - Which made the reading GEOMETRY-dependent: two terminals with the same font on one retina
 *    display returned different "device cells", tripping `warnOnCellDrift`'s 0.01 threshold on an
 *    ordinary multi-terminal canvas. That is the line the device checklist arms the tester with,

     *
     * READ FROM THE NODE'S OWN COMPUTED STYLE, never a literal. **This deliberately does not read
     * the `--radius-lg` token**: `.term-node` is authored as a literal `border-radius: 10px` while

     * itself and leave a crescent of canvas inside each bottom corner — the same class of artifact
     * as L4, mirrored. Asking the element resolves whatever the stylesheet actually says (token,
     * literal, or a future theme override) and cannot desync from it.
     *
     * The BORDER WIDTH is subtracted because `border-radius` describes the BORDER box while the
     * plate is the body box, which sits one border inside it. CSS rounds that inner box by
     * `radius - border`, so a plate rounded by the OUTER radius would curve slightly tighter than
     * the node's own clip all the way round the corner.

     * ONE RADIUS AND ONE BORDER — exact for this node, an approximation in general.
     * `borderBottomLeftRadius` is the HORIZONTAL half of a corner CSS allows to be elliptical, and

     * single number because `.term-node` is authored with one uniform radius and `1px` side and
     * bottom borders. An elliptical radius or asymmetric side borders would need the vertical half
     * and the side width as well — and an elliptical corner would additionally need the SDF to take
     * a `vec2` radius, so this is a two-file change, not a wider `parseFloat`. Same instinct as the
     * `%` refusal below: this is not a CSS length engine.
     *
     * Only the bottom corners are shaped, and the GL layer owns that rule rather than this call

  // order, so by the time this runs xterm has already re-measured its character cell and its
  // renderer's `dimensions.css.cell` — the number `setupGlyph` registers the grid with — is the
  // NEW one. A font change reaches us as a `glyphEpoch` bump raised synchronously from the
  // generation notification, i.e. BEFORE that commit; re-registering there would pin the grid to
  // the old cell size forever (a grid's cell size cannot be changed after `register`). The font
  // settings are in the deps as well as the epoch, so the re-setup still lands after the options
  // even if the two ever arrive in separate renders. Do not move this effect above the one above.
  //
  // It also owns every state in which this node must not be on the shared canvas although it is
  // mounted — `glyphOff` names them all (collapsed, ⌘M, stacked over another node, being dragged)
  // and the ref beside it carries the same answer to `setupGlyph`'s own gate. Each drops the grid
  // and re-registers on the way back, through the SAME teardown/setup machinery that collapse and
  // ⌘M have always used: `teardownGlyph` clears `glyphMounted` (so `term-node--glyphgrid` comes off
  // the node root) and removes `glyphgrid-mode` from the xterm element, which is exactly what makes
  // the body opaque and the DOM rows visible again. Nothing here is a special case for stacking.
  //
  // ORDERING, the second time: `glyphOff` is built from a RENDER-TIME read of the opaque set, which
  // Canvas stores during its own render — i.e. before this component rendered at all. So on the
  // commit that ends a drag, `dragging: false` and the post-drop overlap answer arrive TOGETHER,
  // and this effect makes one decision instead of attaching a glyph and tearing it down again a
  // pass later. Do not "simplify" that read into state; state is exactly what lagged.
  //
  // `dragging` (this node's own prop) is kept alongside because it flips synchronously at gesture
  // start and needs nobody else. Children of a dragged GROUP frame never get it — React Flow's
  // `getDragItems` excludes them — which is why the set carries `gestureTerminalIds` too, and why
