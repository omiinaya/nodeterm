 * This lives in ONE place on purpose: the state machine (observer lifecycle, hidden-since stamp,
 * timer arm/clear, the fire-time re-checks) is the whole risk of the feature, and two copies of it
 * drift — the first pair already disagreed about guard ORDER and lost half the reasoning comments.
 * The component keeps only what is genuinely its own: what "loading"/"content" mean for it, and how
 * to tear down and rebuild its page.
 *
 * The observer is created ONCE (mount-stable). Re-creating it on every state flip would re-arm the
 * hidden timer each time — `observe()` re-reports immediately — so a page could sit hidden forever
 * without ever reaching the window. Every mutable input is therefore read through a ref at fire
 * time, including the SETTING: switching the saver off must disarm a timer armed minutes earlier.
