/**
 * Warmed renderer cache of `project-settings:launch-info` (`projectLaunchInfoNow` /
 * `ensureProjectLaunchInfo` / `invalidateProjectLaunchInfo`) — the `permissionMode.ts`
 * `ensureClaudeCliCaps`/`claudeCliCapsNow` shape, keyed per project instead of app-global.
 *
 * Module-level, NOT zustand: nothing renders directly off this — it is read at the moment a launch
 * needs to know whether a shared-sourced value is trusted, same reasoning permissionMode.ts gives
 * for its own memo.
 *
 * `cache`/`generation` are BOTH keyed by projectId so one project's invalidate never disturbs
 * another's warm entry. `generation` is claimed FRESH by every fetch this module actually issues
 * (not merely bumped by `invalidate`): a write is honored only while its own claimed value is still
 * the current one. This closes two distinct ways an abandoned fetch can otherwise clobber a fresher
 * answer:
 *  - `invalidateProjectLaunchInfo` bumps it directly and drops the in-flight entry, so an in-flight
 *    fetch that predates the invalidate is superseded even if nothing ever re-`ensure`s.
 *  - the ENSURE_WAIT_MS timeout (below) drops the in-flight entry WITHOUT touching the generation —
 *    on its own, a fetch that never settles (a dropped Server Edition WS-RPC request neither times
 *    out nor rejects — see permissionMode.ts's `CAPS_WAIT_MS` doc) would otherwise leave `inFlight`
 *    pointing at an exhausted promise forever, so every later `ensure` for that project just
 *    rejoins it and NO fresh wire call is ever made again. Dropping the entry lets the next `ensure`
 *    issue a real new fetch, which claims its OWN generation — so if the original fetch finally
 *    answers after that, its stale generation no longer matches and its write is silently dropped,
 *    exactly like the invalidate case.
 * Neither path cancels the abandoned fetch (there is nothing to cancel it with) — only its write is
 * ever silenced, never the promise itself.

/**
 * The REACTIVE mirror of the cache above — and only of the two cosmetic terminal values
 * (`terminal.theme` / `terminal.fontFamily`), never of the trust verdict.
 *
 * The cache is deliberately not a store: a launch READS it at the moment it launches, so nothing
 * needs to re-render when it changes. Live terminal appearance is the one consumer that does — a
 * project's theme has to reach terminals that are already on screen — and a module-level `Map` can
 * never notify them. Rather than turn the whole cache into a store (which would re-render every
 * terminal on the canvas whenever an unrelated launch field or trust bit moved), this carries the
 * appearance slice alone, so `useXtermVisualSettings` can subscribe shallowly to exactly what it
 * renders.
 *
 * Written ONLY by `syncVisuals`, on the same generation-guarded branch that writes `cache` — and
 * deliberately NOT cleared by `invalidateProjectLaunchInfo`. The mirror is last-known appearance,
 * not a cache entry, and the difference matters because `invalidate` runs after EVERY project
 * settings commit of any family: clearing here would drop the project's theme (and, with a project
 * font, re-fit the grid of a possibly co-attached pty twice) on its way to re-reading the very
 * document that is about to hand the same value back — a visible flash on every committed field,
 * seconds wide on an SSH project.
 *
 * Holding is self-healing, which is why it needs no expiry: all three `invalidate` call sites
 * re-`ensure` immediately, and that answer OVERWRITES this entry unconditionally — a project whose
 * override was just deleted answers `{ theme: undefined, fontFamily: undefined }`, which clears it.
 * The only state that can persist a stale value is one where the re-read never lands at all, and
 * there the honest thing to show is the appearance the project last actually asked for.
