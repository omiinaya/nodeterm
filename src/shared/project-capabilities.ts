/**
 * Per-project capability switches — the FIRST of their kind in nodeterm.
 *
 * Before this file, `Project` carried exactly two policy fields (defaultAccountId,
 * defaultPermissionMode) and there was no per-project settings surface at all. Browser control
 * needed one and agent-to-agent messaging needs the same one, so the mechanism lives here ONCE:
 * the key set, the copy, the strict read, and the file round-trip. Adding a capability is a line in
 * PROJECT_CAPABILITIES plus an entry in PROJECT_CAPABILITY_COPY — no persistence code changes and,
 * critically, no second clone-notice implementation (see core/project-capability-consent.ts).
 *
 * THESE FIELDS LIVE IN .nodeterm/project.json, WHICH IS GIT-SHARED. That is a hazard to be handled,
 * not noted: a hostile cloned repo ships `agentBrowserControl: true` and the clone's first agent
 * turn would otherwise hold the capability. Two things make that survivable and BOTH are required:
 *
 *  1. The switch alone grants nothing. Every capability must additionally require state this app
 *     run built and never persisted (browser control: the in-memory ownership ledger; a cloned
 *     project.json cannot pre-populate it, and `Project.ropes` — which IS persisted and git-shared —
 *     is deliberately never consulted for ownership).
 *  2. First use in a project the user has not personally switched on raises a one-time notice,
 *     recorded MACHINE-LOCALLY (IndexEntryV3.capabilityAck), never in project.json.
 *
 * If (2) is ever dropped as friction, this field must move to a machine-local store. That is the
 * trigger, written down where the decision is, not only in the design doc.

 * `true` while the capability must refuse. It exists for exactly two kinds of caller: display (a
 * Settings switch showing the file's state) and the notice decider's `enabledInFile` input.
 * Grants go through `projectCapabilityGrantedFor` (@shared/project-capability-consent), pinned by
 * project-capability-consent.test.ts "a switch that is on but unanswered grants nothing".
