/**
 * Per-project settings document — sibling of `.nodeterm/project.json`, same trust boundary.
 *
 * `.nodeterm/settings.json` (this file's shape) is GIT-SHARED hostile input exactly like
 * project.json: hand-editable, auto-adopted by "Open folder…", and for an SSH project it lives on
 * the remote host. Every sanitizer here therefore NEVER THROWS on malformed input — an unrecognized
 * or foreign shape degrades to "field absent", never an exception that would block a load — and
 * drops anything it does not recognize rather than passing it through.
 *
 * Two documents layer over this schema (see `resolveProjectSettings`):
 *  - the SHARED doc (this file, `ProjectSettingsFileV1`) — what the repo ships.
 *  - a LOCAL doc (`ProjectLocalSettings`) — this machine's own overrides, never git-shared, which
 *    can also blank a whole family via `ignoreShared` without needing to override every key in it.
 *
 * `projectTrustContent` (Task 3) is the *other* half of the trust boundary: a canonical string of
 * everything a family could actually EXECUTE, for a caller that needs to know whether a family's
 * meaning has changed since it was last approved (the same shape of problem `execTrusted` solves
 * for node-exec.ts).
